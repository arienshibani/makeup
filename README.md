# Makeup ðŸ’„

Ever find yourself deep inside a project tree, furiously typing `cd ../../..` just to run the root `make` commands?  Makeup is A tiny ZSH plugin that climbs up your directory hierarchy until it finds the closest `Makefile`, runs the targeted command if it exists, then drops you right back where you started.

## ðŸ’… Usage

Let's say you have a `makefile` in your root directory, with a `hello` command defined within it:

```makefile
hello:
  @echo "Hello, world!"
```

With the `makeup` plugin, you can now run that `make hello` command from any subdirectory, deep inside the project ðŸ‘‡

```bash
# ~/repos/makeup
$  ll
   29B  Makefile
   128B demofolder

# ~/repos/makeup 
$ cd demo/level1/level2/level3

# ~/repos/makeup/demofolder/level1/level2/level3 
$ make hello

ðŸ§— cd ..
ðŸ§— cd ..
ðŸ§— cd ..
ðŸ§— cd ..

"Hello, World!"

# ~/repos/makeup/demofolder/level1/level2/level3 
$
```
