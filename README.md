## ðŸ’„ makeup: Run Your Root Makefile from Anywhere

### The Problem  
Ever find yourself deep inside a project tree, furiously typing `cd ../../..` just to run `make`? You peek at your prompt, realize you forgot to switch back, andâ€”ughâ€”repeat. Itâ€™s a workflow speed bump that never stops.

### The Solution  
**makeup** to the rescue! A tiny Zsh plugin that magically climbs up your directory hierarchy, finds the nearest `Makefile`, runs your `make` command there, and drops you right back where you started. No aliases, no manual `cd`, no sweat.

## ðŸš€ Why Youâ€™ll Love It

- **Zero-config**  
  Clone it, enable it, and forget it.  
- **Smart Lookup**  
  Hops upward until it spies a `Makefile`.  
- **Full Transparency**  
  It invokes the real `make`â€”so all your targets (and your sanity) remain intact.
